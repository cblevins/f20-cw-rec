**Note**: *this course is likely different from other history classes you may have taken. There are no traditional essays. This is not because writing isn't important. It's because a major goal of this course is to understand the different forms and mediums through which people narrate, interpret, and make sense of the past. This is especially important with the advent of digital media and when discussing a topic like the Civil War. One of the best ways to develop literacy of these different forms of history is to actually engage in the process of making them for yourself.* 

### Participation and Attendance (25%)

Students will be participating remotely, primarily via Zoom, during the scheduled class time of M/W 12:30-1:45pm. Prior to class, you are expected to have completed the readings or other assignments and be prepared to discuss them. Your grade will be based on your attendance, contributions to in-class activities and discussions, how you interact with your peers during class, whether you have done the readings or other short assignments, and arriving on-time. 

- **Slack discussion posts**: As part of your participation grade, you will also post discussion questions and comments for particular class days. Students will be broken into groups that will alternate days, so that you will be responsible for posting discussion questions roughly every other or every third class. On days that you are assigned to post on Slack, you will need to write 2-3 discussion questions or comments and post them in the `#discussion` channel on Slack **by 9:00am the day of class.** You are encouraged to respond to your classmates' questions, post links to relevant articles or other material, or think of other ways to set up a fruitful discussion of that day's readings and topics. 
- **Graduate students enrolled in HIST 5212**: As part of your participation, you will also sign up for a class period during which you will make a short (3-5 minute) presentation over Zoom on any topic of your choosing that is loosely related to that day's subject. You are expected to complete additional reading for that day and then synthesize the material into an accessible presentation for your classmates that connects to some of the larger themes of the course.

### Podcast #1: The 1619 Project (15%)

Podcasts have experienced a surge of popularity in the recent years. During this semester you will be both listening to history podcasts and producing your own in an effort to gain literacy in an increasingly important medium for interpreting the past. The first podcast you make will serve serve as an introduction to the mechanics of making podcasts while helping you explore the topic of slavery in US history. To do so, you will be making a podcast about the *1619 Project* from Nikole Hannah-Jones and the *New York Times*. [Full description of the assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/podcast-1).

*Due Friday, September 11th, by 11:59PM*

### Peer Review: Podcast #1 (5%)

Each student will provide feedback for TWO other podcasts from the rest of the class using [the same rubric]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/podcast-rubric-blank.docx) that I use. I will be assigning podcasts to each student to review. Submit this feedback by sending a DM (direct message) via Slack to the two podcast creators + Professor Blevins. See class email for more specific instructions.

*Due Sunday, September 13th by 11:59PM*

### Reacting to the Past: The Fate of John Brown, 1859 (10%)

You will be conducting a historical simulation, *The Fate of John Brown, 1859*, during two class periods in September. The simulation is set within a Virginia courthouse in 1859, and each student will take on the persona of a historical figure from that time as they hold a "conference" to decide the fate of John Brown following his raid on Harpers Ferry. You will be evaluated on two components: your participation during the simulation (including a short formal speech) and a retrospective essay on the experience. More details will be distributed prior to the start of the simulation.

*Speech due in class either Monday, September 21st or Wednesday, September 23rd*

*Written Reflection due Friday, September 26th by 11:59AM.*

### Podcast #2: Civil War Memorial (15%)

In your second podcast, you will select a Civil War memorial, statue, or monument to research. You and your partner will then record a podcast examining about some element of the memorial and its history. [Full description of the assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/podcast-2).

*Due Sunday, October 18th by 11:59AM*

### Peer Review: Podcast #2 (5%)

Each student will provide feedback for TWO other podcasts from the rest of the class using [the same rubric]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/podcast-rubric.docx) that I use. I will be assigning podcasts to each student to review. Submit this rubric by sending a DM (direct message) via Slack to the two podcast creators + Professor Blevins.

*Due Wednesday, October 21st by 2:30PM (start of class)*

### Digital Media Project (25%)

In your final project, you will be creating a historical interpretation or narrative that focuses on how a specific dimension, event, person, etc. of the Civil War and Reconstruction era has been remembered and its impact on the present-day United States. This must be conveyed through some sort of digital media: a podcast episode, video, animated film, 3D virtual reconstruction, online map, game, etc. Regardless of the format, the key requirement is that you must engage in an analysis of your topic that is: a) substantively researched and contextualized, b) clearly and compellingly communicated, and c) supported by historical evidence. You can work individually or in small groups to complete this project.

*Rough Draft of project due Monday, November 30th by 2:30PM.*

*Final version of project due Sunday December 6th by midnight.*
