title: Podcast #1: The 1619 Project
permalink: /podcast-1/

### Assignment Description

In your first podcast you will be focusing on the 1619 Project, a collection of essays, poems, short fiction, and photographs led by Nikole Hannah-Jones of the *New York Times*. Published in August of 2019 to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of enslaved Africans arriving in British North America, the project attempted to reframe the larger narrative of US history by placing slavery and its legacy at the center of that story. In the intervening year the project has become a flashpoint in the partisan "culture wars," to the point where in July of 2020 Senator Tom Cotton introduced a bill that would withdraw federal funds from any school that taught the 1619 Project in its classrooms.

History is an act of interpretation, and the 1619 Project offers a particular interpretation about the centrality of slavery to the founding of the United States. For the purposes of this assignment we will be focusing on the project through the lens of historiography, or how different historians have interpreted that topic and how those interpretations have changed over time. Each student will read the essays listed below under Readings. Then in pairs, you will make a podcast that offers an overview of the project and the historiographical debate around slavery's relationship to the founding of the United States. Both students will introduce the 1619 Project's specific interpretation about slavery's role in the colonial United States, the Revolutionary War, and the founding of the United States. Then one student will present a concise summary of how historians have critiqued the project's interpretation, while the other student will present a concise summary of how historians have responded to those critiques. 

*Deadline: Friday, September 11, by 11:59PM*

### Assignment Details

Read all of the essays listed below (note instructions for some readings). Then, in pairs, you will plan and then **record a podcast that is approximately ten minutes long**. Your recording should include the following elements:

- Introduce yourselves
- Music of some kind during the podcast
- "Outro" at the end of the podcast
- A brief introduction to the 1619 Project and its interpretation of slavery during Colonial America, the Revolution, and the founding of the United States, drawing on Hannah-Jones's essay for your evidence.
- A summary of historians' debates over this interpretation, drawing on the Wilentz and Harris readings for your evidence.
- Your own assessment of the project's interpretation. What arguments made by Hannah-Jones, Wilentz, and/or Harris do you find convincing? Which do you not? Feel free to take this in any direction you want - each student can agree or disagree with each other, speak more broadly or personally about US history and education, etc. 

In addition to the recording, you should submit a a **detailed outline** of your episode that you write prior to recording. This should *NOT* be a word-for-word script, but should consist of organized notes about the points each person plans to make along with the full transcriptions of any quotes you want to use. 

Each episode should be submitted as follows to [this Dropbox link](comingsoon):

1. Podcast in MP3 format (<50MB file size) with the file named: `Student1LastName-Student2LastName-podcast-1.mp3` (ex. `Blevins-Ronaldo-podcast-1.mp3`).
2. Word document of the written outline of your episode. The file should be named: `Student1LastName-Student2LastName-podcast-1.docx` (ex. `Blevins-Ronaldo-podcast-1.docx`).
