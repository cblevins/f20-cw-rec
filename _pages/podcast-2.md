### Assignment Description

In your second podcast you will select a Civil War memorial, statue, or monument and conduct research about its history. You and your partner will then plan out and record a podcast about the memorial. You have wide latitude to take this assignment in any direction you like. You could, for instance, focus mainly on the history that the memorial is commemorating (a particular battle or person), or the context surroundings its construction, or present-day controversies around its presence or removal.

*Deadline: Sunday, October 18th, by 11:59PM*

### Assignment Details

You and your partner will **record a podcast that is approximately 10-15 minutes in length**. In addition to the recording, you should submit a **detailed outline** of your episode that you write prior to recording and a **Works Cited**. The outline should *NOT* be a word-for-word script, but should consist of organized notes about the points each person plans to make along with the full transcriptions of any quotes you want to use. The Works Cited should consist of a list of all the sources you consulted while researching and recording your podcast.

Each episode should be submitted as follows to [this Dropbox link](comingsoon):

1. Podcast in MP3 format (<50MB file size) with the file named: `Student1LastName-Student2LastName-podcast-2.mp3` (ex. `Blevins-Ronaldo-podcast-2.mp3`).
2. Word document of: a) the written outline of your episode, and b) a Works Cited containing sources you consulted for your episode. The file should be named: `Student1LastName-Student2LastName-podcast-2.docx` (ex. `Blevins-Ronaldo-podcast-2.docx`).
